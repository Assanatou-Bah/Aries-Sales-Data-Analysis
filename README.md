# Aries Sales Data

Welcome to my Sales Dashboard Project! 
This project was created as part of the DSN Ladies in AI Mentorship Program, where I worked on analyzing sales data to provide actionable insights for decision-makers at Aries Management, a marketing organization.



## Project Overview

### What Business Problems Was I Solving?

The goal of this dashboard was to help Aries Management answer critical business questions like:

1. Which regions, products, and distributors are performing the best?

2. Where are the sales gaps, and what areas need immediate attention?

3. How are weekly sales trends changing over time?

4. What insights can help the team allocate resources more effectively?

This dashboard aimed to make sense of the data, highlight trends, and provide clarity for better business decisions.


## How I Designed the Dashboard

Designing this dashboard involved a few key steps:

**1. Data Preparation:**
Cleaned and standardized the dataset, fixing issues like inconsistent entries in the distributors column

Created a Date Table to support weekly comparisons and trends.

**2. Focus on Insights:**
Highlighted metrics like Total Weekly Sales, Week-over-Week growth, and top-performing regions, products, and distributors.

**3. Clear Visualizations:**
Used bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards to present insights in a way thatâ€™s easy to understand.

**4. Interactivity:**
Added slicers and filters for users to explore data by region, product, and time period.



## What Were the Results?
The final dashboard provided answers to key questions, such as:

**Total Weekly Sales:** Weekly trends showed that Week 5 had the highest sales at $1.31B.

**Top Region:** Bauchi was the best-performing region with $82.27M in sales.

**Top Products:** Chicken 100 Cubes and Maggi Mixpy were the best-sellers, each generating $263.11M.

**Top Distributor:** Rufai Muhammed led with sales of $82.27M.

**Trends:** The Week-over-Week growth metric highlighted key periods of improvement and decline.

This dashboard made it easy for Aries Management to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in their sales strategy.
